# pfd_utils
Routines for handling .pfd binary files created by presto. Most of the code is from Scott Ransom's python wrappers for presto. 
I have modified the code so that it works independent of a presto installation and replaced pgplot based plotting with matplotlib based plotting.
Code might be buggy and is currently under active testing.

Required python packages:
numpy, scipy and matplotlib
